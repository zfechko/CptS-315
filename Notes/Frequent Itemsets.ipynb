    "- Simplest question: find sets of items that appear \"frequently\" in the baskets\n",
    "- *<mark>Support</mark>* for itemset *I* = the number of baskets containing all items in *I*\n",
    "    - Sometimes given as a percentage\n",
    "- Given a *<mark>support threshold</mark> s* sets of items that appear in at least *s* baskets are called <mark>*frequent itemsets*</mark>\n",

    "- Support = 3 baskets\n",

    "- Notice items do not have to be \"in\" baskets\n",
    "    - But it is better if baskets have small numbers of items, while items can be in large numbers of baskets\n",

    "- <font style='color:orange'>baskets</font> = documents; <font style='color:orange'>items</font> = words.\n",

    "- Walmart sells 100,000 items and can store billions of baskets\n",
